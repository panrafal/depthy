DEPTHY
======

Images with depthmap playground.

Depthy shows Google Camera Lens Blur photos with 3D parallax effect and creates animated GIFs from them. Plus extracts the depth map and enables you to create your own!

This is the source of the http://depthy.me/ webapp. Contributions more than welcome!

## How to build

- Install node + npm
- Run anywhere: `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
- Run in project directory: `npm install` and `bower install`
- For local development server run: `grunt serve`
- For deployment: `grunt build`

## Docker image
If you want to simply run depthy locally, you can use [Docker.io](https://www.docker.com/).

Once docker installed, simple run:
```
$ docker run --rm -t -i -p 9000:9000 ndahlquist/depthy
```

Then go to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

## How to help

There is a lot of stuff you can do with depthmaps. If you have ideas and you know how to code,
You already know how to help ;) I'm pretty lax on formalities, just make it work and at least 
try to follow conventions of the code...
